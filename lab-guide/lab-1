# Enable and use Microsoft Fabric

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that provides a single, integrated environment for data professionals and the business to collaborate on data projects. Fabric provides a set of integrated services that enable you to ingest, store, process, and analyze data in a single environment. Microsoft Fabric's unified management and governance make it easier for data professionals to work together on data projects. Fabric removes data silos and the need for access to multiple systems, enhancing collaboration between data professionals.
Before you can explore the end-to-end capabilities of Microsoft Fabric, it must be enabled for your organization. You may need to work with your IT department to enable Fabric for your organization.

   >**Note:** Microsoft Fabric has launched as a public preview and is temporarily provided free of charge when you sign up for the Microsoft Fabric (Preview) trial. Your use of the Microsoft Fabric (Preview) trial includes access to the Fabric product experiences and the resources to create and host Fabric items. The Fabric (Preview) trial lasts for a period of 60 days but may be extended by Microsoft, at our discretion.
   
## Task 2 : Create resources in Microsoft Fabric

   After you've created your Fabric enabled workspace, you can start creating resources in Fabric. You can create resources in Fabric using the Create menu in the upper left corner of the Power BI service.

You may notice that Fabric experiences look similar to other Microsoft data offerings. Fabric is built on Power BI and Azure Data Lake Storage, and includes capabilities from Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Machine Learning. What makes Fabric unique is that it brings these capabilities together in a single, SaaS, integrated experience without the need for access to Azure resources.
